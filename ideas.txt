ideas:
Bugs

Focus on pleasing progression

Exponentiality.

Recursive progression?
Starting again from the beginning is always fun, it seems?


You bug

choose bug?
bug builds things
time passes
bug builds more things
repeat


Time passing - all objects run onTick method

Created objects
Objects can move around

Give obejcts hp/
Weather occurs, can do bad things
Storms - damages buildings and people. Global? Probably.

Logging damages & death:
	Add Lines if at location
	If you're controlling 

Building needs resources
Resources can be gathered from inventory & From nearby terrain.
Buildings must do something.

They can protect you from bad weather.
They can store resources and protect them from bad weather.



Perhaps you can possess whatever creatures you feel like?

Skills & stats:
Terrain:
	Fertility
	Flatness?
	Minerals
Creatures:
	Building
		Decides the speed at which you build things
		And Quality of said things
	Surveying
		Decides the ease with which you can scout terrain and deduce it's power
	Combat
		Combat
	Durability
		Health & resistance to certain effects
	Growin Plants
		PLANMTSN


Basic gameplay loop?
Build shit
Things occur that will damage shit & 
natural events 

Exploration?
Finding cool areas could be fun

Rise and fall
You possess bugs and shit and make them build things
At some point things happen and stuff will inevitably collapse
But depending on how it collapses you can rebuild from the ashes something cooler
Rinse and repeat, gives you a natural ebb and flow of stuff

Perhaps it doesn't necessarily collapse fully

It seems somewhat unintuitive at the moment
to progress you must eliminate progress
Instead maybe it should just simply be required for some reason
but then because you are picking up from the ashes, the next run will be better than before.
Ruins can be explored and rebuilt
Survivors can be found to help



Methods of collapse:
Catastrophic natural disasters
Excessive raiding by another kingdom
Rebellion
